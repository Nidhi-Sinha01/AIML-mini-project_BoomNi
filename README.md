# Image Classification using CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project focuses on implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The objective is to correctly classify these images into their respective categories.

## Introduction

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are included.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-cifar10.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the `train.py` script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This will train the CNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

3. Once trained, run the `evaluate.py` script to evaluate the model:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

   This will evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

## Results

After training and evaluation, the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any other relevant metrics will be displayed. Additionally, visualizations of training/validation accuracy and loss will be available.
